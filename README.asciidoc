Simple movie indexer and database. Currently only feature is miner process that
will go through your files, find movies and put them into database together
with some metadata. It supports multiple storages, so you can index your DVDs
or other removable media and it should also detect when file just moved
somewhere else. That's about it for now, there are plenty of ideas
https://github.com/miska/tomovee/issues[floating around] and waiting for
someone to implement them ;-)
